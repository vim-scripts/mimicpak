The MimicPak is a set of 17 colorschemes which were converted (ripped-off)
from other editors and IDEs and that use and share some common
tweaking options, like the font style among others.  Some original,
personal, invented and cloned colorschemes are included too.

The IDEs/Editors may have had more colorschemes, but only some
(which I think that were great) are included.  Most of the colorschemes
are only for gVim, this is so, because of time reasons and available
number of colors.  However, you can use the CSApprox plugin
( vimscript#2390 ) to use them on 88/256 color terms.  Although some of them
have the cterm colors for 16 color terminals.

For a fast way to try out these schemes, the included mimicpak.vim
plugin script creates a submenu "MimicPak" under the "Themes" menu on the main
menubar.

After correctly installing this pack, you can see the help with:
   :h mimicpak
       >> to get general help
   :h mimic-overview
       >> quick overview of colorschemes by background colors.
   :h mimic-options
       >> to see the shared options.
   :h name_of_scheme.vim   
       >> to see specific options (if any) of a  particular colorscheme.

================
SHARED OPTIONS
================
All the included colorschemes use and share the following common option
variables (these can either be set as: buffer, window, tabpage or global) :

   * mimic_font_style:  controls the style of the fonts.

        let  mimic_font_style = 0    " schemes will use plain fonts
        let  mimic_font_style = 1    " schemes will use bold fonts
        let  mimic_font_style = 2    " schemes will use italic fonts
        let  mimic_font_style = 3    " schemes will use bold and italic fonts

   * mimic_colorize_gui:  if set, GUI elements (menu, toolbar,
        scrollbar) will be colorized (works only for some GUIs).

That said, you only need to set these options once and you'll get the
same look when changing to another of these schemes.

For further help about these, try:
   :h mimic_font_style
   :h mimic_colorize_gui

Most of the included colorschemes are intended to be "easy on the eyes"
(well, almost) and I hope that you might find at least 2 or 3
colorschemes from this pack that you could use for every day coding :)
